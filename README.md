# Digital-Twin-for-Induction-Furnaces
Saint Gobain is interested in improving the performance of its induction furnaces for melting steel. Saint Gobain has provided us with data that has been generated from multiple melts comprising several heats. The data is of various electrical parameters, heat time, amount of material charged in each melt, the output obtained from each melt, and the tapping temperature of each melt. Initial and Final refractory profiles are also available for all the melts. This data is obtained from different customers of Saint Gobain and the induction furnaces are of different sizes.

exploratory data analysis has been carried out to understand the data and frame a set of high-level objectives. After the exploratory analysis, different Machine Learning models have been explored to predict various induction furnace parameters for a new heat. The lack of Refractory lining profile data after every melt was treated as a missing data problem. An optimization framework was then developed to find the refractory lining profile that minimizes the error in predictions. Using curve fitting, different refractory lining profiles were tried out to find the refractory lining profile that is closest to the true data.
